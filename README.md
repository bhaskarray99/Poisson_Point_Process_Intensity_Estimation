# Estimating intensity function of Poisson Point Processes - Review and Illustrations

This is a review on some techniques for estimating intensity function of Poisson Point Processes including parametric as well as non-parametric methods. We also consider extension of parametric methods to include the effect of spatially varying covariates on the intensity function. A detailed discussion of approaches to the problem of bandwidth election for kernel estimators is presented. These methods are illustrated using simulated and real-life datasets.
