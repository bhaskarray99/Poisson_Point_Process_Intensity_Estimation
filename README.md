# Estimating intensity function of Poisson Point Processes - Review and Illustrations

This is a review on some techniques for estimating intensity function of Poisson Point Processes including parametric as well as non-parametric methods. We also consider extension of parametric methods to include the effect of spatially varying covariates on the intensity function. A detailed discussion of approaches to the problem of bandwidth election for kernel estimators is presented. These methods are illustrated using simulated and real-life datasets. Our discussions and findings are presented in the PDF report.

The R codes used in the project are available in the Appendix of the report. A notebook comprising of all the codes shall be uploaded shortly.
